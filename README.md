My simple website made with simple and plain html + css + javascript.
I made my own mobile responsivenes, auto language detection, desing, animations, etc. 
I like small websites without the need for bloated web frameworks.

# Todo List:

- [ ] fix mobile width in 404
- [ ] blog section
    - [ ] youtubers sub-sections in blog
- [ ] js to detect code class="C++" and color C++ correctly
