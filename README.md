# Ariel Parra WebSite
Previously arielparra.tech
**NOW INACTIVE**
My simple website made with simple and plain html + css + javascript.
I made my own mobile responsivenes, auto language detection, desing, animations, etc. 
I like small websites without the need for bloated web frameworks.

# Todo List:

- [x] fix mobile width in 404 (fixed with style="overflow: hidden;">)
- [ ] blogs
- [ ] js to detect code class="C++" and color C++ syntax correctly
