# Ariel Parra WebSite
Previously arielparra.tech
My simple website made with simple and plain html + css + javascript while trying to follow HTML5 standarts.
I made my own mobile responsivenes, auto language detection, desing, animations, etc. 
I like small websites without the need for bloated web frameworks.
I also developed my own Python-based images site generator called `md2html.py`, which enables me to create custom HTML websites while increasing efficiency by 45% and I also use a Makefile to make each site I want.


# Todo List:

- [x] fix mobile width in 404 (fixed with style="overflow: hidden;">)
- [ ] blogs
- [ ] js to detect code class="C++" and color C++ syntax correctly

# Thanks
