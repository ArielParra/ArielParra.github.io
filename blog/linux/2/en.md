      <p>
      UNIX is an operating system created at the beginning of the 70s in AT&T by Dennis Ritchie (C language creator) and Ken Thompson (B language creator).
      </p>
      <p><mark>Single UNIX Specification:</mark> It is a standard for operating systems to use the UNIX tredemark, with interfaces for C language, shell and commands.
      </p>
      <p><mark>UNIX filosofy (Doug McIlroy):</mark> Write programs that do one thing very good, that work together (input is the output of another) and that handle streams (bytes strings for I/O), because they are a universal interface.
      </p>
      <p>Everything is a file, devices, keyboards, hard drives, etc. these are managed with streams and stored in the /dev folder.

          #### 2.3 Free/Libre Philosophy
          [⤷](./blog/linux/2/#3){:class="hidden-link"}
        </div>

      <p>
      The Free/Libre software philosophy is related to Richard Stallman and his GNU project, which says that software must respect the freedom of the user,
      freedom of distribution, freedom of use, freedom of study, etc. Going against Proprietary software and closed-source, binary blobs, 
      non-permissive licenses and EULAs and DRM.

          #### 2.4 BSD
          [⤷](./blog/linux/2/#4){:class="hidden-link"}
        </div>
      <hr>
      <p>Berkeley Software Distribution, is an operating system created at the University of Berkeley in California, it is open source under a BSD Licences and originally was
      an extension of AT&T’s Research UNIX, unlike Linux this has the BSD C library, although they can share certain GNU utilities.
      </p>  
      The two most important forks are:
    
      - <mark>FreeBSD:</mark> is a ["large"](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/stable/12/) project with many forked operating systems departing from it, such as FreeNAS, pfsense, etc.
      - <mark>OpenBSD:</mark> is a relatively more ["small"](https://cvsweb.openbsd.org/src/) than freebsd, it is innovative and creates new tools used throughout the unix community like [SSH](https://www.openssh.com/), while being one of the safest operating systems.
      
      These may have certain [advantages and disadvantages](https://serverfault.com/questions/5267/what-is-good-about-the-bsds/5352#5352) regarding Linux.
